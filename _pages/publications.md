## [Illiquidity of the Annuity: a Potential Solution to the Annuity Puzzle](https://juilinchen.github.io/files/Draft_Annuity_Puzzle.pdf) 

<details>
    <summary><u>Abstract</u></summary>
    <p>Annuity puzzle refers to the inconsistency between theoretical results and empirical data on annuity demand. In this paper, we construct a monetary general equilibrium dynastic model with money and annuities. There are two dimensions of an asset: return and liquidity. The bequest motive is an important factor that lowers liquidity of annuity. When the liquidity of annuities is too low, it would generate a theoretical result in which the annuity accounts for almost zero percent in the retirement wealth. A higher inflation rate reduces the value of money, and a stronger bequest motive reduces the liquidity of the annuity. Consequently, a higher bequest motive and a lower inflation rate reduce the demand for the annuity, which generates the theoretical result being consistent with empirical data.
