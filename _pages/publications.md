## Long- and Short-run Effects of Interest Rates on Builders and the Housing Market

<details>
    <summary><u>Abstract</u></summary><p> 
  This paper shows effects of real interest rates on builders and the housing market in the long run and during the transitional dynamics under fixed-rate mortgages (FRM). I develop a heterogeneous agent model with different structures of mortgages and liquid assets, lumpy adjustment of housing, and the construction sector with time to build to decompose effects of interest rates on housing prices. I find that, in a long-run stationary equilibrium, there are heterogeneous response of policy functions of households and the distribution effect affecting the housing demand, while an increase in interest rates always deter construction. When interest rates temporarily increase, the distribution effect is weak since it needs time for households to shift to the new distribution. Therefore, the negative response of builders can partially offset or  overturn the decrease of price from a lower demand in the short run. I show that the housing price dynamics can be opposite between economies with and without the builder. By calibrating the model, instead of the lock-in effect, builders' negative response to interest rates is the main force of the recent high housing price under rising rates.

## [Illiquidity of the Annuity: a Potential Solution to the Annuity Puzzle](https://juilinchen.github.io/files/Draft_Annuity_Puzzle.pdf) 

<details>
    <summary><u>Abstract</u></summary>
    <p>Annuity puzzle refers to the inconsistency between theoretical results and empirical data on annuity demand. In this paper, we construct a monetary general equilibrium dynastic model with money and annuities. There are two dimensions of an asset: return and liquidity. The bequest motive is an important factor that lowers liquidity of annuity. When the liquidity of annuities is too low, it would generate a theoretical result in which the annuity accounts for almost zero percent in the retirement wealth. A higher inflation rate reduces the value of money, and a stronger bequest motive reduces the liquidity of the annuity. Consequently, a higher bequest motive and a lower inflation rate reduce the demand for the annuity, which generates the theoretical result being consistent with empirical data.

## Who Gets the Consumer Credit? A Credit Allocation Problem in a Heterogeneous Agent Model

<details>
    <summary><u>Abstract</u></summary><p> 
 This paper aims to provide a quantitative framework to analyze the effect of housing price on non-homeowners’
consumption and consumption inequality via the credit channel. Empirically, the unsecured debt accounts for a
higher household debt fraction when housing prices drop after 2000. In addition, non-homeowner’s share of debts
increases when the housing price drops. Theoretically, non-homeowners do not have houses on their balance
sheets, hence housing prices do not directly affect non-homeowners’ consumption. However, a higher housing
price can crowd out the unsecured debt via the credit market by increasing the pledgeability of houses and
mortgage balance. This paper builds an Aiyagari-type model with endogenous housing and saving-borrowing
choices and shows that an increase in housing prices loosens the mortgage borrowing constraint and crowds
out unsecured debts. The model-generated pattern shows that low-wealth households are non-homeowners who
finance through unsecured debts, the middle-class households are non-homeonwers who save, while high-wealth
households are homeowners who finance through secured and unsecured debts. Throughout this credit channel,
a higher housing price decreases non-homeowners’ debt share and non-homeowners’ consumption.
